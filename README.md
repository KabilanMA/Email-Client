# Email-Client

CLI based Email Client

Both Codes built in Netbeans and VsCode are in the repository. Also the JAR file of the project included. Check the README.TXT in dist to run the JAR file from commandline. If the program doesn't sent the mail only possible reason would be email address or password in the code itself is wrong  or changed.  If that's the case change the email and password to a vaild one and run the code from the IDE or create the JAR file again.
